/** 
CROSS-BROWSER COMPATABILITY 

In front end development, we write code that executes on our users machines.
As a result, we encounter the issue of various runtime environments - different browsers,
different browser versions, mobile, desktop, etc. Implementing different features 
at different times. Part of the job of the front end developer is to ensure a good 
experience across all devices the product is meant to support. There are several key concepts
to be familiar with in order to do this well:
  - Progressive Enhancement/Graceful Degradation
  - Polyfills/Feature Detection
  - Unit & end-to-end tests run across browsers
